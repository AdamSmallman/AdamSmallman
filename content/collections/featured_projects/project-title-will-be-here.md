        text: "The idea for this app stemmed from my own frustration with overly complex meal planning apps that lacked the ability to add personal recipes. To ensure a seamless user experience, I conducted research and developed two user personas to understand the needs of potential users. I then created wireframes and carried out user testing, asking participants to complete key tasks such as adding and deleting meal plans, searching for recipes, and adding new recipes. This iterative process helped refine the app's design, making it as intuitive and efficient as possible."

        text: 'Many meal planning apps on the market are overloaded with unnecessary features, making them complicated and frustrating to use. Despite testing numerous apps, I found none that offered a simple, intuitive experience while allowing users to add their own recipes. This gap in functionality made meal planning more of a hassle than a help.'
